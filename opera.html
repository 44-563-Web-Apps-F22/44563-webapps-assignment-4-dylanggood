        <h3>Act 2 Scene 1</h3>
        <pre> <p>Enter Robin and Adam melodramatically. They are greatly altered in appearance, Robin wearing 
            the haggard aspect of a guilty roué; Adam, that of the wicked steward to such a man.</p>
            
            <h5>Duet—Robin and Adam</h5>
            <p>
            ⁠I once was as meek as a new-born lamb,
            ⁠I'm now Sir Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
            ⁠With greater precision,
            ⁠(Without the elision)
            ⁠Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
            
            ⁠And I, who was once his valley-de-sham,
            ⁠As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!
            ⁠The dickens may take him—
            ⁠I'll never forsake him!
            ⁠As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!
            
            How dreadful when an innocent heart
            Becomes, perforce, a bad young Bart.,
            And still more hard on old Adam
            His former faithful valley-de-sham!
            </p>

            <h5>Rob.</h5> <p>This is a painful state of things, Old Adam!</p>
            
            <h5>Adam.</h5> <p>Painful, indeed! Ah, my poor master, when I swore that, come what would, I would serve you in 
            all things for ever, I little thought to what a pass it would bring me! The confidential adviser to 
            the greatest villain unhung! Now, Sir, to business. What crime do you propose to commit to-day?</p>
            
            <h5>Rob.</h5> <p>How should I know? As my confidential adviser, it's your duty to suggest something.</p>

            <h5>Adam.</h5> <p>Sir, I loathe the life you are leading, but a good old man's oath is paramount, and I obey. Richard Dauntless is here with pretty Rose Maybud, to ask your consent to their marriage. Poison their beer.</p>

            <h5>Rob.</h5> <p>No—not that—I know I'm a bad Bart, but I'm not as bad a Bart as all that.</p>

            <h5>Adam.</h5> <p>Well, there you are, you see! It's no use my making suggestions if you don't adopt them.</p>
