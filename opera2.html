        Happily coupled are we,
        ⁠You see—
        I am a jolly Jack Tar,
        ⁠My star,
         And you are the fairest,
         The richest and rarest
        Of innocent lasses you are,
        ⁠By far—
        Of innocent lasses you are!
        
        Fanned by a favouring gale,
        ⁠You'll sail
        Over life's treacherous sea
        ⁠With me,
        
         And as for bad weather
         We'll brave it together,
        And you shall creep under my lee,
        ⁠⁠My wee!
        And you shall creep under my lee!
        
        For you are such a smart little craft—
        Such a neat little, sweet little craft,
         Such a bright little, tight little,
         Slight little, light little,
        Trim little, prim little craft!

        My hopes will be blighted, I fear,
        ⁠My dear;
        In a month you'll be going to sea,
        ⁠Quite free,
         And all of my wishes
         You'll throw to the fishes
        As though they were never to be;
        ⁠Poor me!
        As though they were never to be.
        
        And I shall be left all alone
        ⁠To moan,
        And weep at your cruel deceit,
        ⁠Complete;
         While you'll be asserting
         Your freedom by flirting
        With every woman you meet,
        ⁠You cheat—
        With every woman you meet!
        
        Though I am such a smart little craft—
        Such a neat little, sweet little craft,
         Such a bright little, tight little,
         Slight little, light little,
        Trim little, prim little craft!
